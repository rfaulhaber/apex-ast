# apex-ast

`apex-ast` is a Rust library for parsing Apex files and generating ASTs.

**NOTICE**: this project is incomplete and deprecated. I'm not satisfied with the approach this library takes. I may restart this project at some point but I'm releasing it as-is with the hope that it might be useful.
